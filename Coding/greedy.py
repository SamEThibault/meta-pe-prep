# Greedy Algorithms Basics
# Best seen through a comparison of DP and Greedy approaches:

# Example: rearrange a set of digits to make the largest number
# DP: Try all of the combinations, then we can pick the best result after
# Greedy: start with the best option we have for the first digit, then go from there
